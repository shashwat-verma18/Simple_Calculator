# Simple Calculator

I created a simple and easy to use calculator app for both Android as well as IOS users. I made this project in Android Studio and coded it with Dart. My main purpose of this project was to practice getting used to the Google's new toolkit Flutter.

# Features
* Responsive UI.
* It can perform all basic operations.
